    <h3>I am a  failure.Becuase i fail in my life every step</h3>
    <p>Failures teach us the best lessons in life. One cannot deny the fact that life is indeed a slow struggle. At times, one wonders if they can make it until the next day or not. In this essay on failure is the pillar of success; one learns that life gives a taste of both failures and success. 

        A man cannot always be successful in life, and none have achieved it so far. That is because failures tend to attack when nobody expects it in different forms. It can be in the form of financial or medical issues. 
        
        Even successful men tend to fail after succeeding immensely in life. One must understand that failures highlight the drawbacks in the preparation. It is like a student appearing for an exam and scoring bad marks. </p>
