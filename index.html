    <h2S>Failure!</h2>
    <h3>I am a  failure.Becuase i fail in my life every step</h3>
    <p>Failures teach us the best lessons in life. One cannot deny the fact that life is indeed a slow struggle. At times, one wonders if they can make it until the next day or not. In this essay on failure is the pillar of success; one learns that life gives a taste of both failures and success. 

        A man cannot always be successful in life, and none have achieved it so far. That is because failures tend to attack when nobody expects it in different forms. It can be in the form of financial or medical issues. 
        
        Even successful men tend to fail after succeeding immensely in life. One must understand that failures highlight the drawbacks in the preparation. It is like a student appearing for an exam and scoring bad marks. </p>

            <p>When I allow something to compromise my integrity, I act like a loser.

                I act like a loser when I cast blame at someone other than me because what I am really doing is relinquishing my agency.
                
                When I fall prey to inaction that feels like action also known as worry, guilt or rumination. I really should be doing something.
                
                When I expect it’s someone else’s job to make me happy or meet any of my needs.
                
                When I catch myself speaking ill of someone or when I spend more time describing how someone else could have done something better while doing nothing myself.
                
                When I give up or back out. When remaining safe becomes more important than the experiences granted to me by being exposed.</p>

            <p>Failures are the pillars of success, does not mean one must keep failing. When one fails in something, dejection instantly hits in. They are disappointed with themselves and everybody around them. 

                Entrepreneurs did not accept failures and become dejected. In this paragraph on failures are the pillars of success; one can read about Bill Gates. He founded Microsoft. Like Steve Jobs, he quit college and began his journey in his garage. 
                
                This resulted in the formation of one of the largest software firms in the world. Walt Disney was sent out because of his lack of imagination. It did happen unbelievably. That resulted in cartoon characters like Mickey Mouse and Donald Duck. They are cherished by people of all ages.</p>
